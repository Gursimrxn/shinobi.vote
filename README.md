# Shinobi — Privacy-First DAO for India

Shinobi is India’s first privacy-first DAO platform, enabling **anonymous, verifiable, and relayer-free voting**.  
It combines **zero-knowledge proofs, ENS pseudonyms, and Filecoin/Lighthouse storage** to allow citizens to submit proposals, vote securely, and track governance across Indian states — all while preserving complete privacy.

> First objective: baseline monorepo structure + README. Subsequent commits will populate the Next.js app, smart contracts, and shared packages.
