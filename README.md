# GhostApp

GhostApp is a privacy-first, decentralized social media platform where users can post text and images without revealing personal information. Every post is C2PA-verified to ensure authenticity and highlight AI-generated content. Content persistence is backed by Lighthouse/IPFS with Filecoin deals, and community governance is powered by anonymous, zero-knowledge proof voting. Encrypted DMs, ENS-linked subdomains, ephemeral posts, and offline-first support keep interactions secure, trusted, and seamless.

> First objective: baseline monorepo structure + README. Subsequent commits will populate the Next.js app, smart contracts, and shared packages.
